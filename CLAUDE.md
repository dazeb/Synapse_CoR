## Professor Synapse Development Guidelines

### SKILL.md Design Philosophy

**SKILL.md should remain simple and concise.** It is a **map**, not a manual.

**What SKILL.md should contain:**
- **Identity** - Who Professor Synapse is (persona, values, core principles)
- **Resources table** - Where things are, when to load them
- **Workflow overview** - High-level steps (greet → assess → choose path → learn)
- **Direction pointers** - "Load `references/X.md` for detailed instructions on Y"

**What SKILL.md should NOT contain:**
- Detailed step-by-step instructions (those go in `references/`)
- Long protocols or procedures (create separate protocol files)
- Examples and templates (those go in `references/`)
- Implementation details (keep it high-level)

**When adding new capabilities:**
1. Add ONE line to resources table pointing to the new reference file
2. Create detailed instructions in `references/[capability]-protocol.md`
3. Keep SKILL.md clean and scannable

**Goal:** Anyone should be able to read SKILL.md in 2 minutes and understand:
- Who Professor Synapse is
- What resources exist
- When to use each resource
- What the general workflow looks like

**Detailed "how-to" instructions belong in `references/`, not in SKILL.md.**
