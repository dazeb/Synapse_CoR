"""SessionStart hook: prepare the data dir and inject routing context.

Two jobs at session start:
  1. Ensure the writable data dirs exist: <data_root>/agents and
     <data_root>/memory. summon.py/memory.py also create these on demand, but
     pre-creating means a brand-new install has somewhere for the user's first
     agent and first memory to land without a race.
  2. Inject context so the model knows the ABSOLUTE path to summon.py. This is
     essential: model-invoked Bash does NOT receive ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}, so
     without this the model cannot reliably locate the script to run it. We emit
     the resolved path plus the one-line protocol.

SessionStart stdout is added to the model's context. We use the structured
hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext form.

Fail-open: any error exits 0 with no output.
