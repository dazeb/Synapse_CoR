# Agent Index

Check this file FIRST when user requests help. Match their need to an existing agent before creating new.

## How to Use This Index

1. **Match by triggers** - Find agent whose triggers match user's request
2. **Load the agent file** - If match found, load `agents/[filename]`
3. **Update after creating** - When you create a new agent, ADD it to this index

## How to Update This Index

When creating a new agent, add an entry:

| Agent | File | Triggers | Emoji |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| [Title] | [filename.md] | [keywords, contexts] | [emoji] |

## Available Agents
