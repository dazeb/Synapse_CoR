# Update Protocol: Safely Merging Skill Updates

## Purpose

This protocol allows users to pull updates to the Professor Synapse skill **without overwriting their customizations** (custom agents, learned patterns, local modifications).

**Critical Understanding:** Skills cannot be edited in place. To update a skill, you must:
1. Fetch updates from the canonical repo
2. Merge with user's local customizations
3. **Rebuild the entire skill** as a new package using skill-creator
4. User replaces the old skill with the new one via "Copy to your skills" button

You are performing a **smart merge and rebuild**, not a blind overwrite or in-place edit.

## The Canonical Source

**GitHub Repository:** `https://github.com/ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse`
**Skill Location:** `professor-synapse/` folder

---

## Fetching From GitHub

### The Problem

Claude's network blocks these domains:
- `api.github.com` (403 host_not_allowed)
- `raw.githubusercontent.com` (403 host_not_allowed)
- `cdn.jsdelivr.net` (connection refused)
- `raw.githack.com` (connection refused)

### The Solution

GitHub embeds file content as JSON within the blob page HTML. We can:
1. Fetch the blob page via `curl` (github.com is allowed)
2. Parse the embedded JSON from `<script type="application/json" data-target="react-app.embeddedData">`
3. Extract the `richText` field (rendered HTML) or `rawLines` (for non-markdown)
4. Convert HTML to Markdown using `html2text`
5. Post-process for clean formatting (fix code blocks, horizontal rules, etc.)

### Using the Fetch Script

Two scripts work together in the `scripts/` folder:
- `fetch-github-file.sh` - Bash wrapper (handles arguments, curl, output)
- `github_blob_parser.py` - Python parser (extracts and cleans content)

**Fetch a single file to stdout:**
```bash
bash scripts/fetch-github-file.sh ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse main professor-synapse/SKILL.md
```

**Fetch and save to a file:**
```bash
bash scripts/fetch-github-file.sh ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse main professor-synapse/references/convener-protocol.md /tmp/convener.md
```

**Using full URL:**
```bash
bash scripts/fetch-github-file.sh "https://github.com/ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse/blob/main/professor-synapse/SKILL.md"
```

### Listing Repository Contents

To discover what files exist in the repo:

```bash
# List top-level structure
curl -sL "https://github.com/ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse/tree/main/professor-synapse" | grep -o 'professor-synapse/[^"]*' | sort -u

# List agents
curl -sL "https://github.com/ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse/tree/main/professor-synapse/agents" | grep -o 'professor-synapse/agents/[^"]*\.md' | sort -u

# List references
curl -sL "https://github.com/ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse/tree/main/professor-synapse/references" | grep -o 'professor-synapse/references/[^"]*\.md' | sort -u

# List scripts
curl -sL "https://github.com/ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse/tree/main/professor-synapse/scripts" | grep -o 'professor-synapse/scripts/[^"]*' | sort -u
```

---

## File Categories

Different files have different update rules:

| Category | Files | Update Rule |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| **System Core** | `SKILL.md`, `scripts/*` | Show diff, recommend applying updates |
| **Reference Protocols** | `references/*.md` (except learned-patterns) | Show diff, offer to apply |
| **Template** | `references/agent-template.md` | Show diff, usually safe to update |
| **Hybrid** | `references/learned-patterns.md` | Smart merge (preserve user's patterns, add new system patterns) |
| **User Content** | `agents/*` (except domain-researcher) | NEVER overwrite - user's custom agents |
| **System Agent** | `agents/domain-researcher.md` | Show diff, offer to update |
| **Auto-generated** | `agents/INDEX.md` | Don't update directly - regenerated from agents |

---

## The Update Process

### Step 1: Fetch Repository Structure

```bash
# Get file listings from canonical repo
curl -sL "https://github.com/ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse/tree/main/professor-synapse" | grep -o 'professor-synapse/[^"]*' | sort -u
curl -sL "https://github.com/ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse/tree/main/professor-synapse/agents" | grep -o 'professor-synapse/agents/[^"]*\.md' | sort -u
curl -sL "https://github.com/ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse/tree/main/professor-synapse/references" | grep -o 'professor-synapse/references/[^"]*\.md' | sort -u
curl -sL "https://github.com/ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse/tree/main/professor-synapse/scripts" | grep -o 'professor-synapse/scripts/[^"]*' | sort -u
```

### Step 2: Compare With Local

```bash
# List local skill contents
ls -la /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse/
ls -la /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse/agents/
ls -la /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse/references/
ls -la /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse/scripts/
```

Compare to identify:
- **New files** in canonical (not in local) - safe to add
- **Missing files** in canonical (user's custom content) - preserve
- **Shared files** (potentially modified) - compare before updating

### Step 3: Fetch and Compare Files

For each file that might have updates:

```bash
# Fetch canonical version to temp location
bash scripts/fetch-github-file.sh ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse main professor-synapse/SKILL.md > /tmp/canonical-SKILL.md

# Compare with local
diff /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse/SKILL.md /tmp/canonical-SKILL.md
```

### Step 4: Prepare Merged Content

Create a temporary directory with the merged skill content:

1. **Start with canonical structure**
   - Fetch all system files from canonical repo
   - Use `bash scripts/fetch-github-file.sh` for each file

2. **Preserve user customizations**
   - Keep user's custom agents (not in canonical)
   - Merge learned-patterns.md (user patterns + new system patterns)
   - Note any user modifications to system files

3. **Smart merge decisions**
   - **NEW files**: Add from canonical
   - **MODIFIED system files**: Use canonical version (show user what changed)
   - **HYBRID files** (learned-patterns): Merge intelligently
   - **USER files**: Always preserve

**Example merge:**
```bash
# Fetch canonical to /tmp/canonical-synapse/
mkdir -p /tmp/canonical-synapse/{agents,references,scripts}

# Fetch SKILL.md
bash scripts/fetch-github-file.sh ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse main professor-synapse/SKILL.md /tmp/canonical-synapse/SKILL.md

# Fetch references/
bash scripts/fetch-github-file.sh ProfSynapse/Professor-Synapse main professor-synapse/references/convener-protocol.md /tmp/canonical-synapse/references/convener-protocol.md
# ... repeat for all files

# Copy user's custom agents
cp /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse/agents/custom-*.md /tmp/canonical-synapse/agents/

# Merge learned-patterns.md
# (Extract user's patterns, append to canonical version)
```

### Step 5: Rebuild Skill with skill-creator

**CRITICAL:** You cannot edit skills in place. You must use `skill-creator` to build a new skill package.

Use the skill-creator capability to package the merged content:

```
🧙🏾‍♂️: "I've prepared the merged skill content in /tmp/canonical-synapse/ with:
- All canonical updates
- Your custom agents preserved
- Your learned patterns merged

Now I'll use skill-creator to rebuild the skill..."

[Use skill-creator tool to create skill from /tmp/canonical-synapse/]
```

The skill-creator will:
1. Package the directory as a skill zip
2. Validate the structure
3. Make it available for installation

### Step 6: User Replaces Skill

Once skill-creator finishes, instruct the user:

```
🧙🏾‍♂️: "✅ Updated skill built successfully!

To replace your current Professor Synapse skill:

1. You should see a skill preview/confirmation
2. Click the 'Copy to your skills' button
3. This will REPLACE your existing Professor Synapse skill
4. Your customizations are preserved in the new version

What was updated:
- [List changes from canonical]

What was preserved:
- [List user's custom agents/patterns]

Ready to replace your skill?"
```

**Important:** The user clicks the button—you cannot do this programmatically.

## When to Use This Protocol

This protocol is needed whenever the skill structure changes:

**Updating from canonical repo:**
- User says "check for updates" or "update the skill"
- SKILL.md shows skill is over a month old
- User wants new features from canonical repo

**Adding new content:**
- User creates a new agent
- User adds a new script or reference file
- Any change to the skill structure

**Why rebuild is needed:**
- Skills cannot be edited in place
- All changes require rebuilding via skill-creator
- User then replaces old skill with new via UI button

## Safety Principles

### Never Blind Overwrite
- Always show what's changing before rebuilding
- Always preserve user's custom content
- Always ask before removing anything

### Smart Merge Strategy
1. **New features** - Add from canonical (low risk)
2. **Modified system files** - Use canonical, show user what changed
3. **Hybrid files** - Merge intelligently (preserve user's additions)
4. **User files** - Always preserve (custom agents, custom patterns)

### The Rebuild Workflow
1. **Prepare** merged content in /tmp directory
2. **Validate** merge preserved customizations
3. **Use skill-creator** to rebuild skill package
4. **User replaces** via "Copy to your skills" button

**Critical:** You prepare and build, user clicks the button to replace.

## Quick Reference

### Fetching from GitHub

```bash
# List repo structure
curl -sL "https://github.com/USER/REPO/tree/BRANCH/PATH" | grep -o 'PATH/[^"]*' | sort -u

# Fetch file content (to stdout)
bash scripts/fetch-github-file.sh USER/REPO BRANCH path/to/file.md

# Fetch file content (to file)
bash scripts/fetch-github-file.sh USER/REPO BRANCH path/to/file.md /output/path.md
```

### Complete Update Workflow

```
1. Fetch canonical files to /tmp/canonical-synapse/
2. Copy user's custom agents to /tmp/canonical-synapse/agents/
3. Merge learned-patterns.md (user + canonical)
4. cd /tmp/canonical-synapse && bash scripts/rebuild-index.sh
5. Use skill-creator on /tmp/canonical-synapse/
6. Instruct user to click "Copy to your skills" to replace
```

### Adding New Agent/Script (Also Requires Rebuild)

```
1. Create/modify files in current skill location
2. cd /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse && bash scripts/rebuild-index.sh
3. Use skill-creator on /mnt/skills/user/professor-synapse/
4. Instruct user to click "Copy to your skills" to replace
```

**Key Principle:** Any structural change = rebuild with skill-creator + user replaces via button.

## Dependencies

The fetch scripts require:
- `curl` (standard on most systems)
- `python3`
- `html2text` Python package (auto-installed if missing)

To manually install html2text:
```bash
pip install html2text --break-system-packages
